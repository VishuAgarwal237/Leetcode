Create helper function to determine if a certain number is happy, then while loop on n

1. Helper Funct: Initialize happy = 0, and then loop x > 0 and increment happy by the square of x%10, return happy outside loop
2. Create a set to keep track of what has been seen
3. while n != 1 and has not been seen yet (because if the number has been seen, the following iterations would result in the same ones previously, so it is not a happy number), 
add n to the seen set and then re-assign n to its happy val by doing n = getH(n)
    
4. return n == 1 outside the loop








        def getH(x):
            happy = 0
            while x > 0:
                happy = happy + (x % 10)**2
                x = x // 10
            return happy 
        seen = set()
        while n != 1 and n not in seen:
            seen.add(n)
            n = getH(n)
        return n == 1
