1. Initialize two pointers left and right at 0, and the longest substring length at 0, and an empty set
2. While loop through the whole array with left,
    if the element is in the set, then increment the left pointer and remove the char at left index from the set
    else, add the element to the set and increment right
    longest = max(longest, right - left)
3. return longest


        sets = set()
        i = 0
        j = 0
        longest = 0
        while j < len(s):
            if s[j] in sets:
                sets.remove(s[i])
                i = i + 1
            else:
                sets.add(s[j])
                j = j + 1  
            longest = max(longest, j - i)
        return longest
