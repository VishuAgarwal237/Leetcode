1. Default profit to 0 and lowest stock to the first val in prices
2. Loop through each value in prices
    if curr is less than lowest, then lowest = curr
    if the curr stock - lowest is greater profit than profit, profit = curr - lowest
3. return profit

        profit = 0
        low = prices[0]

        for x in prices:
            if x < low:
                low = x
            if (x - low) > profit:
                profit = x - low
        return profit
