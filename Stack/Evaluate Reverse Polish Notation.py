'''
1. Create a apply_op function to check operation chars

2. Iterate through tokens
    If x is not an operation, then append it to the stack, 
    Else, apply the operation on the last 2 vals of the stack, and then pop them both, and then append the total of the operation
3. Return the total (No need to increment to the total by itself bc the operations use the running total each time already)
