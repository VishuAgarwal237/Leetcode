Loop through the emails and split it into local and domain, and then do the checks for "." and "+" and then append the new local and @domain to a set

1. Create an empty set to check what we have seen
2. Loop through emails
3. Split into local and domain vars using email.split("@", 1)[0] and email.split("@", 1)[1]
4. Replace "." in local with "" 
5. If "+" in local, split it at that index and get the first part only
6. Add this new local with @domain to the set
7. return the length of the set outside the loop
