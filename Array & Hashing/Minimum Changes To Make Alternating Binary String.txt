Get the number of the changes for making it 0,1,.. or 1,0,.. and return the min

1. changes1 and changes2 vars
2. Check the 0,1, case first
    Loop through the string, and if its an even index and the value at that index is not equal to a 0, then increment changes1
    if its an odd index and the value at that index is not equal to a 1, then increment changes1
3. Check the 1,0, case now
    Do similar process as step 2 but flip the checks
4. return min(changes1, changes2)
