Loop from the back and add the current amount of times we have seen that ratio to the count variable

1. Initialize empty seen dict and count variable
2. Loop through rectangles reversed
3. if the ratio is in seen, then increment count by its value (freq of times we have seen it so far), and then increment its value in the dict by 1 to increase its freq by 1 too
4. if not, then add it with value of 1
5. return count outside the loop



class Solution:
    def interchangeableRectangles(self, rectangles: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        
        seen = {}
        count = 0
        for rec in reversed(rectangles):
            if (rec[0]/rec[1]) in seen:
                count = count + seen[rec[0]/rec[1]]
                seen[rec[0]/rec[1]] += 1
            else:
                seen[rec[0]/rec[1]] = 1                
        return count
