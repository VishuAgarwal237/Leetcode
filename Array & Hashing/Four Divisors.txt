Loop through nums and find each values divisors, and then the total number is 4, then increment count by the sum of the 4 divisors

1. Intitialize empty var count
2. Loop through nums, and create a temp set with 1 and x already in it to keep track of divisors
3. Loop through the range of 2 and the sqrt root of int 
4. if the num % divisor == 0, add the divisor and num/divisor to temp
5. after the inner loop, check if temp == 4, and if so, then increment the sum of temp to count
6. return count outside all loops

        for x in nums:
            temp = {1,x}
            for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(x)+1)):
                if x % i == 0:
                    temp.add(i)
                    temp.add(x/i)
            if len(temp) == 4:
                count = count + sum(temp)
        return int(count)
