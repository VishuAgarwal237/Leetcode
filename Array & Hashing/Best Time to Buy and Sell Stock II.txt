1. curr_min at first price and set profit to 0
2. Loop through prices
    if prices[i] is less than the curr_min, curr_min = prices[i]
    elif prices[i] is greater than curr_min, sell right there so add the profit to profit, and then set curr_min to prices[i] again as default
3. return prices


class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        
        curr_min = prices[0]
        profit = 0
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            if prices[i] < curr_min:
                curr_min = prices[i]
            elif prices[i] > curr_min:
                profit = profit + (prices[i] - curr_min)
                curr_min = prices[i]
        return profit
