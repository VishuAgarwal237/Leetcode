1. Set current max at last element in array
2. Loop back to front in array
3. Set a temp var to be the currMax
4. re-compute curr_max to be max of itself and the curr number we are on
5. Make current value temp because we are setting it to the largest element on tis right exclusive (not including itself)
6. make last element -1 in arr
7. return arr





class Solution:
    def replaceElements(self, arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        
        currMax = arr[-1]
        for i in range(len(arr)-1,-1,-1):
            temp = currMax
            currMax = max(currMax, arr[i])
            arr[i] = temp
            
        arr[-1] = -1
        return arr
