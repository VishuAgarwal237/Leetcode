1. Loop through the chars of the first element in the outer loop
2. loop through the rest of the elements 
    if they all have the char too, then add that char to temp
    else, return temp because we found the breaking point at where the prefixes start to differ



class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
 
        temp = ""
        for i in range(len(strs[0])):
            for y in strs:
                if i == len(y) or strs[0][i] != y[i]:
                    return temp
            temp = temp + strs[0][i]
        return temp
