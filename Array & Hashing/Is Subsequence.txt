Two pointer approach to loop througb both strings and increment pointers whenever the chars are the same

1. Initialize two pointers at 0
2. Loop through len(s) and len(t) to make sure we don't go out of bounds on either
3. if the chars are the same, then increment the s index
4. Always index the t index
5. return i == len(s) outside the loop because if we reached the end of s, then we reached the end of the subsequence we were checking




class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i < len(s) and j < len(t):
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                i = i + 1
            j = j + 1
        return i == len(s)
