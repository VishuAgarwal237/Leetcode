Use Moore's Voting Algorithm

1. count = 0 and res = 0 where count counts how many times a certain element occurs
2. Loop through nums
    if the count is 0, then make res equal to the current num we are on
    if the current number is equal to res, then increment count
    else, decrement count
3. return res

This works because of the known fact that The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times and always exists in nums.
So, when we loop through, we track the first num and everytime it doesn't appear since then, we decrement its count and if the count is 0, we start tracking the current number then







        count = 0
        res = 0
        for num in nums:
            if count == 0:
                res = num
            if num == res:
                count = count + 1
            else:
                count = count - 1
            
        return res
